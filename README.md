This is "unexpectedly now" a discontinue project from Quadrex. My goal was to support "vanilla" IWNetserver matchmaking while you still have IW4M features with dedis and private match.

For those LAN party users that still using IWNetserver and alteriwnet 1.3.3.7a. This will be a nice upgrade for you.


all codebase is belong to NTAuthority from refint. I only repack the source and modified a few things to get it quickly started for quadrex community.
